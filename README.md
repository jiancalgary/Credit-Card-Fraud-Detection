# **Machine Learning Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection**
## In this project I use the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to detect fradulent credit card transactions in a real-world (anonymized) dataset of european credit card transactions. I evaluate the performance of the model on a held-out test set and compare its performance to a few other popular classification algorithms, namely, Logistic Regression, Random Forests and Neural networks, and show that a well-tuned XGBoost classifier outperforms all of them.
